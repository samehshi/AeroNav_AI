### Project Description
🎯 **Project Origin & Purpose**
This project reflects years of hands-on experience in civil aviation navigation telecommunications and message switching operations. As someone who has worked extensively in Navigation Telecommunication Centers and Message Switching Systems, I built this tool to address the daily operational challenges we face.
**Target Audience:** Aviation telecommunications professionals, AFTN/AMHS operators, message switching center staff, and navigation services personnel.
**Goal:** Share practical knowledge and create a useful tool for our industry while demonstrating how AI can enhance our operational efficiency.

🛠️ **Core Capabilities**
1. **ICAO Airport Code Intelligence**
   * Instant lookup from operational database (15+ major airports)
   * Automatic web search fallback for unknown codes
   * Perfect for verifying unfamiliar airports in flight messages
   * Batch processing for multiple lookups

2. **AFTN-to-AMHS Address Conversion**
   * Convert legacy 8-character AFTN addresses to X.400 format
   * Essential for AFTN/AMHS gateway operations
   * Batch conversion for migration projects
   * Follows ICAO Annex 10 standards

3. **Aviation Document Reference (RAG)**
   * Upload operational manuals, ICAO annexes, AIP supplements
   * Query procedures and regulations instantly
   * Critical for compliance verification during operations
   * Reduces manual document searching time

4. **Operational Web Search**
   * Real-time lookup for aviation definitions
   * Verify current NOTAM information
   * Cross-check procedural requirements

💼 **Real-World Operational Value**
**For Message Switching Centers:**
   * Quick ICAO code verification during message processing
   * AFTN/AMHS address translation for gateway operations
   * Instant reference to operational procedures
   * Reduce message handling time

**For Navigation Telecommunication Staff:**
   * Procedural compliance checking
   * Address format validation
   * Training tool for new operators
   * Batch processing for routine tasks

**For Operations Supervisors:**
   * Monitor system telemetry
   * Session logging for quality assurance
   * Batch tools for shift handover tasks

🏗️ **Technical Implementation**
**Built on Production-Grade Architecture:**
