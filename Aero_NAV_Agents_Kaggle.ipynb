    "## 🎛️ Layer 4: Gradio Dashboard Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this cell does:**\n",
    "- Creates a comprehensive web interface using Gradio\n",
    "- Implements chat interface with async message processing\n",
    "- Adds batch processing tools for multiple ICAO/AFTN operations\n",
    "- Provides document ingestion capabilities\n",
    "- Includes telemetry monitoring dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it's needed:**\n",
    "- Provides a user-friendly interface for non-technical users\n",
    "- Enables batch operations for efficiency\n",
    "- Allows uploading and processing of documents\n",
    "- Shows system health and usage metrics\n",
    "- Demonstrates professional UI/UX design\n",
    "\n",
    "**Enhanced Features:**\n",
    "- **Airport Lookup with Fallback**: When an ICAO code is not found locally, the system automatically performs a web search to find the information\n",
    "- **Smart Examples**: Includes examples for both known and unknown ICAO codes to demonstrate the web search functionality\n",
    "- **User Feedback**: Clear messaging throughout the search process to keep users informed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interface features:**\n",
    "- **Main Chat**: Interactive AI assistant with example prompts\n",
    "- **Batch Tools**: Process multiple ICAO codes or AFTN addresses at once\n",
    "- **Knowledge Base**: Upload PDFs for RAG processing\n",
    "- **Telemetry**: Monitor system performance and logs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kaggle considerations:**\n",
    "- Uses Gradio for compatibility with Kaggle's environment\n",
    "- Non-interactive mode for notebook display\n",
    "- Optimized for Kaggle's resource constraints\n",
    "- Clean, professional interface design"

   "source": "## 📖 Usage Guide and Best Practices\n\n**How to Use This Console:**\n\n### 1. Interactive Chat\n- Use the main chat interface for conversational AI assistance\n- Ask questions like:\n  - \"What is AMHS?\"\n  - \"Where is airport OJAA?\"\n  - \"Convert HECAYFYX to X.400 format\"\n  - \"What are the flight planning procedures?\"\n\n### 2. Enhanced Airport Lookups\n- **Known ICAO codes**: Get instant results from the local database (e.g., \"KJFK\", \"EGLL\")\n- **Unknown ICAO codes**: The system automatically performs a web search to find the airport information\n- **Batch processing**: Use the Batch Tools section to look up multiple airports at once\n- **Search feedback**: The system provides clear feedback during the web search process\n\n### 3. Batch Operations\n- Use the Batch Tools section for processing multiple items\n- Enter one item per line in the text area\n- Select the operation type (Airport Lookup or AFTN Conversion)\n- Click \"Process Batch\" to get results\n- **Pro tip**: Include unknown ICAO codes to see the web search functionality in action\n\n### 4. Document Management\n- Upload PDF files to build your knowledge base\n- The system will automatically process and index documents using custom GoogleEmbeddings\n- Use keywords like \"procedure\" or \"manual\" to trigger RAG queries\n- **Note**: Custom embeddings avoid pydantic_v1 compatibility issues\n\n### 5. System Monitoring\n- Check the Telemetry section for usage metrics\n- Monitor logs for system events and errors\n- Use the System Status for real-time health information\n\n## 🏗️ System Architecture\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                    Layer 4: Interface                    │\n│              ┌─────────────────────────────────┐        │\n│              │      Gradio Dashboard           │        │\n│              │  Chat • Batch Tools • Telemetry │        │\n│              └─────────────────────────────────┘        │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                  Layer 3: Agent Orchestration            │\n│              ┌─────────────────────────────────┐        │\n│              │      EnterpriseAgent            │        │\n│              │  Gemini LLM • Tool Detection    │        │\n│              │  Session Mgmt • RAG Integration │        │\n│              └─────────────────────────────────┘        │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                  Layer 2: Knowledge & Tools              │\n│  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────────┐  │\n│  │  ICAOTools  │  │  RAGEngine  │  │GoogleEmbeddings │  │\n│  │             │  │             │  │                 │  │\n│  │•Airport LK │  │•Document    │  │•Vector Store    │  │\n│  │•AFTN Conv  │  │ Ingestion   │  │•Fallback Vectors│  │\n│  │•Web Search │  │•Similarity  │  │                 │  │\n│  │             │  │ Search      │  │                 │  │\n│  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘  └─────────────────┘  │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                 Layer 1: State & Configuration           │\n│  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────────┐  │\n│  │Observability│  │Session Mgmt │  │System Config    │  │\n│  │             │  │             │  │                 │  │\n│  │•Telemetry   │  │•Conversation │  │•Persistence    │  │\n│  │•Metrics     │  │ History     │  │•API Keys       │  │\n│  │•Logging     │  │•JSON Storage │  │•Model Settings  │  │\n│  │             │  │             │  │                 │  │\n│  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘  └─────────────────┘  │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n**Key Benefits:**\n- Clean separation of concerns\n- Scalable and maintainable\n- Enterprise-grade observability\n- Production-ready error handling\n\n## 🔧 Technical Architecture\n\nThis system follows a 4-layer architecture with modern Google AI SDK compatibility:\n\n1. **Layer 1: State & Configuration**\n   -
